# Resource: <resource name> delphix_appdata_dsource

In Delphix terminology, a dSource is a database that the Delphix Continuous Data Engine uses to create and update virtual copies of your database. 
A dSource is created and managed by the Delphix Continuous Data Engine.

The Appdata dSource resource allows Terraform to create and delete AppData dSources. This specifically enables the apply and destroy Terraform commands. Modification of existing dSource resources via the apply command is not supported. All supported parameters are listed below.

## System Requirements

* Data Control Tower v10.0.1+ is required for dSource management. Lower versions are not supported.
* This Appdata dSource Resource only supports Appdata based datasources , such as POSTGRES,SAP HANA, IBM Db2, etc.The below examples are shown from the PostgreSQL context. See the Oracle dSource Resource for the support of Oracle. The Delphix Provider does not support Oracle, SQL Server, or SAP ASE.

## Example Usage

The linking of a dSource can be configured through various ingestion approaches. Each configuration is customized to the connector and its supported options. The three PostgreSQL parameter sets below show working examples.

```hcl
# Link dSource using external backup. 

resource "delphix_appdata_dsource" "dsource_name" {
